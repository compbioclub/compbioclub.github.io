> Welcome to CompBioClub! We are a group of computational biologists studied and worked at the Department of Biomedical Science, City University of Hong Kong. Led by `Dr. Lingxi Chen`, our group is dedicated to brige the gap between biomedical science and computational science.

### Hiring 
> We are seeking talented and passionate <a href='/openings'>Research Assistants and PhD candidates</a>.

### Research Interests

+ Single-Cell and Spatial Omics
  To design computational algorithms tailored for the analysis of bulk, single-cell, and spatial omics data. To address the challenges such as imputing missing data, dimension reduction, clustering, data integration, and more.

+ Genomic Structural Aberrations
  To develop specialized tools for the detection and analysis of genomic aberrations, such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs), copy number variations (CNVs), and complex structural variations (CSVs). To identify the aberration biomarkers associated with multiple cancers and complex diseases for precision medicine.

+ AI in Healthcare
  To build diagnostic and prognostic AI models for various conditions, including cancer and complex diseases in humans and animals.

+ Online Biomedical Platforms
  To create user-friendly online webservers and databases that offer integrated analysis pipelines and interactive visualization interfaces. To enable non-bioinformaticians to explore complex biological data with simple mouse operations.
